
1. Use Semantic HTML:
   - Employing semantic HTML elements properly helps convey the structure and meaning of content. For instance, use header,nav,main,article,section, and footer tags to appropriately structure your document.
   <br>
   - Semantic HTML aids screen readers and other assistive technologies in understanding the content and presenting it in a meaningful way to users with disabilities.
<br><br>
2. Provide Descriptive Text with Alt Attributes:
   - Always include descriptive alternative text for images using the `alt` attribute in the `img` tag. This ensures that users who cannot see the images (due to visual impairments or other reasons) can understand the content conveyed by those images.
   <br>
   - Write concise, descriptive alt text that conveys the purpose or information provided by the image.
<br><br>
3. Create Keyboard Accessible Content:
   - Ensure that all interactive elements on your website are accessible via the keyboard. Users with motor disabilities or those who rely on keyboard navigation should be able to navigate through your site easily.
   <br>
   - Use the `tabindex` attribute to specify the order in which elements receive focus when users navigate with the keyboard.
   <br><br>

  Test your website's functionality using only the keyboard to identify and address any navigation or interaction issues.
