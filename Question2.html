HTML entities are special codes used to represent reserved characters and symbols in HTML. 
Here are five commonly used HTML entities:
<br><br>
1. `lt` - represents the less-than symbol ("<").
<br> <br>
2. `gt` - represents the greater-than symbol (">").
<br><br>
3. 'amp' - represents the ampersand symbol ("&").
<br><br>
4. 'quot' - represents the double quotation mark (").
<br><br>
5. 'apos' - represents the single quotation mark (apostrophe) ('), though it's less commonly used.

These entities are used to ensure that certain characters are correctly displayed in HTML and do not interfere with the markup structure.
